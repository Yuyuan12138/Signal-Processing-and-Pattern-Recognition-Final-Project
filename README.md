# Signal-Processing-and-Pattern-Recognition-Final-Project
It is the homework of Signal Processing and Pattern Recognition Final Project.

## How to use it?
1. copy all files in a same path.
2. if you want to draw the Gaussian Noise Image. Run noisefigure.m in MATLAB.
3. if you want to draw PSNR Curve and see images Processed with Different Thresholds. Run Drawing.m in MATLAB.

## What is other files?
1. psnr.m is used to calculate PSNR.
2. ThresholdProcessing.m is used to set different threshold.
3. WaveletDenoising.m is used to Perform Discrete Wavelet Transform.
